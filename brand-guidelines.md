## Logotype

### Construction

The ProcurementExpress.com logotype should always be surrounded by a minimum area of space. The area of isolation ensures that headlines, text or other visual elements do not encroach on the logo. The area is defined by using the height and width of the letter "P".

A margin of clear space equivalent to that height/width is drawn around the logo to create the invisible boundary of the area of isolation.

### Minimum Sizes

There are no predetermined sizes for the ProcurementExpress.com logo. Scale and proportion should be determined by the available space, aesthetics, function and visibility. There is no preset maximum size for the ProcurementExpress.com logo.

However, minimum sizes have been established to safeguard the integrity of the logo at all times:
- **Digital**: 20px minimum
- **Print**: 1cm minimum

## Typography

### Helvetica Bold

We use Helvetica as our primary font family with three main weights:

- **Light**
- **Regular**
- **Bold**

Helvetica Bold is used for signature brand elements.

## Logo Usage

### Correct Usage

- **Primary Brand Color**: Always use logotype over color background
- **Greyscale Version**: Logotype white
- **Knockout Version**: Logotype at 100% black

### Incorrect Usage

NEVER:
- Change or switch ISO or logo colors
- Use unsupported background colors, patterns or full color photography
- Modify ISO or logo scale proportions
- Modify ISO or logo rotation
- Replace font family
- Ignore security margins

## Background Photos

### How to Compose Imagery

The correct composition consists of:
1. Dark primary color background
2. Black and white photography over the background color
   - Blending Mode: Soft Light
   - Opacity: 30%

This creates a professional, consistent look for background images that supports the brand identity.

## Complementing Design Elements

### The Chevron

We use the chevron of the brand as a complement of design, pattern, or miscellaneous graphic element. This distinctive element helps reinforce brand recognition.

### Full Stop

We use a red dot to end big titles, keywords or quotes. This distinctive punctuation element adds character to our typography.

### The Icons System

The system of icons must follow the aesthetic guidelines of the chevron. They should use geometric shapes with the same primary brand color to maintain visual consistency.

## iOS Icons

Our mobile app icons follow a specific sizing system for different contexts:
- iPad
- iPhone
- Spotlight
- Settings

The icons use our distinctive "X" mark in the brand colors against a white background, maintaining the rounded square format of iOS guidelines.
